# SQL_Challenge 🚀

Welcome to the **SQL Challenge Repository** — your one-stop resource to master SQL through practical, real-world questions!

## 🔍 About This Series

This repository is part of a **15-day challenge** where I’ll be posting beginner-to-advanced level SQL questions focused on mastering one of the trickiest yet most powerful concepts in SQL:  
**CTE (Common Table Expressions)**

> 💡 This initiative was born out of my own experience — I struggled with CTEs when I began preparing for interviews. Now, I’m turning that challenge into an opportunity to help others.

## 📅 Daily Structure (Days 1–15)
Each day includes:
- 🧠 A real-world or interview-style SQL question
- ✍️ A clean, well-explained solution
- ✅ Concepts around how and when to use CTEs
- 🔁 Optional challenges for deeper practice
